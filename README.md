Twitter Analysis of Chic-fil-A and Popeyes was conducted when Popeyes released it's much anticipated Chicken Sandwich

Popeyes is a multinational chain of fried chicken fast food restaurants, originally founded in 1972 as “Chicken On The Run”. By 1975, the company was renamed to Popeye’s Famous Fried Chicken, and due to the success, various franchises spawned off of that original restaurant. Today, over 3,000 restaurants in more than 40 different states operate under the Popeyes Brand. When it was first created, Popeyes was envisioned to directly compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), but over the years has expanded its offerings significantly.


Chick-Fil-A likewise was founded in the 1940’s as “Dwarf House” by S. Truett Cathy and after two decades the first Chick-Fil-A was opened in Atlanta, Georgia in 1967. The company present operates around 2,300 restaurants nationwide which is slightly smaller than the amount of Popeyes restaurants. The company was founded with a strong Christian identity and this has caused some controversy over the years related to their stance on same-sex marriage and other LGBT issues.
In August of 2019, Popeyes introduced a fried chicken sandwich in order to compete with other fast food restaurants, most namely Chick-Fil-A. The sandwich, which Popeyes describes as “a fried chicken patty on a brioche bun with several pickles and mayonnaise along with a spicy cajun sauce variation” was an instant hit, with the long wait times and unique branding of the new sandwich going viral.


Along with social media, the event was also widely covered by the national media. Some estimates suggest that Popeye’s was able to gather over $23 million dollars as a result of said publicity derived from social media and general news sites. The sandwich ended up being so popular that Popeyes, who had estimated having enough chicken sandwich inventory to last them 2 months, ended up completely selling out of their chicken sandwiches in just over two weeks by August 27th, 2019.
On October 25th, 2019, Popeyes once again announced that their chicken sandwich would be returning to stores nationwide on November 3rd, 2019. With this re-release, public interest again spiked, with long wait times again occurring and the story again going viral. However, this time public interest sparked different reactions. Videos and tweets showing violence and unrest over this new chicken sandwich began to occur. In one circumstance, a man was stabbed to death for allegedly cutting in line while trying to order the new chicken sandwich.


Other violent incidents occurred in the ensuing months, some of which we were able to capture during our analysis of random Twitter data based on keyword searches. Unexpectedly as well Chick-Fil-A decided to announce on November 18th, 2019 that they were divesting themselves from certain controversial charities which caused them to also go viral on Twitter. While we initially had sought to use Chick-Fil-A as a control group to monitor changes in Popeyes sentiment, suddenly data became available which we had to account for in our analysis.


With this wide chamber of various sentiments available on the internet, we were interested to see how these events impacted people’s thoughts and opinions on the restaurants and if the controversies surrounding them had any impact on public sentiments. We then wanted to be able to leverage the sentiment and Twitter data in order to provide valuable feedback to the companies so they would be in a better position to deal with these types of events.
