Run each of the code one by one. 

Created the whole text analysis scripts by dividing it into multiple parts so that problem can be figured out easily and is easier to read than having all combined in one script

If you running the code one by one, keep in mind that you may not need to call the library every time you do so. 

Also, if you are running the code one after another, you may not need to download the tweets everytime. Instead of search_tweets, you can replace it by read_csv. 
You will already have a csv file after running the code. Just read in that file and carry forward. 

The script is made such that it will automatically save the graphs on your machine so that you don't have to save all the graphs individually.

Happy Learning and hope someone takes it to another level.
